# python3-experiments
Exploring Python3 and various APIs using Python 3 code snippets.

When I try something new I create a simple proof of concept script 
to figure out how to use a feature or new module or API.
Because I might need an example in a future project it seems like a 
good idea to document these experiements.


## Running the samples
It is assumed that:
* the CWD is `~/GitHub/python3-experiments`
* and that `caddy` has been copied to this directory


## Caddy Server API
